# Clustering of Cells Using Complete Gene Expression Profiles

The developments in genomic sequencing tools and especially single cell RNA-seq has brought new opportunities to study developmental biology and cell differentiation. In this study we revisit a paper by Satija et al who used landmark gene expression profiles to determine single cell tissue, and try to separate cells using the complete gene expression profiles. We believe that complete gene expression profiles may hold valuable information and will generalize the approach used by Satija et al. Lacking the data to verify our results our method success remains unknown.
